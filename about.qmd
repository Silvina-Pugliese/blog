I created this blog to share my reflections on topics of my profession that I care about.

I am a senior data analyst in the New Zealand public sector with experience in data analytics, data modeling, and a PhD in physics. I am passionate about using data to inform policy decisions and I have a strong focus on data visualisation and communication. I also love teaching and helping people improve their data skills.\
\
I have founded the R-Ladies chapter in Wellington New Zealand, which I am currently running, and have also volunteered for the Karori based Code Club group in the past dedicating my time and expertise to inspire and teach the next generation of coders.

I would be delighted to chat if you have any questions. Please feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn!
