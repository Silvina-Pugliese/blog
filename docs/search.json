    "text": "Data visualisation plays a critical role for data analysis in two primary ways:\n\nIt is a key aspect of understanding the data.\nWell-designed visualisations can be used to communicate observations and insights from data in a more impactful way.\n\nThe goal is not just to produce a visually appealing visualisation but to ensure that it conveys meaning and that it is useful to its intended audience. At times, data analysts are so familiar with their data that they unintentionally overlook the importance of presenting the message in a clear and coherent manner. This can lead to confusing or overwhelming visualisations for others who are not as familiar with the data."

    "text": "Always plot the data\nVisualising data is a crucial step in exploring and analyzing it. Although calculating summary statistics for each variable in a dataset is a good starting point, it is often insufficient. This is because different datasets can produce similar or even identical summary statistics. Anscombe’s quartet is a powerful demonstration of this, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\nThis screenshot was taken from Cédric Scherer’s ggplot2 course which I highly recommend!"

This is why working with domain and business experts is crucial, as they provide context that is essential for deriving insights from the analysis.\nIt is also beneficial to closely collaborate with domain experts when prototyping visualisations. Their feedback is invaluable in refining the message when we are mapping it into visual form.\nSomething to also consider is that annotations have become a commonplace addition to data visualisations as they provide readers with the contextual information they require to accurately interpret the message."

There are numerous resources available to assist with this step, and some of the ones I use are included in the reference section below.\nThe visualisation should emphasise what is important and enable the observer to understand the point with minimal mental effort. As mentioned earlier, annotations can be included to highlight critical information."

However, I would not discourage the use of other preferred tools, as exceptional visualisations have also been created using Power BI, Tableau, and Excel.\nIt is crucial to remember that the message conveyed by the visualisation is what really matters, rather than the tools used to generate it."

And keep in mind that what may seem obvious to you may not be so for others.\nSelect a chart type that is appropriate for your data and emphasises the intended message. Utilise annotations to provide additional context that readers may need to understand the message.\nDevelop a deep understanding of a visualisation tool and practice using it extensively. For example, you could try to replicate well-designed visualisations to refine your skills."
