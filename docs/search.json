    "text": "The process of modelling business data\nModelling the data of a business is about structuring the data in an effective way, but it is actually more than that.\nWhile learning about this topic, I discovered the work of a renowned pioneer in the field of data modelling: Ralph Kimball. Kimball’s approach focuses on what is known as “dimensional modelling” using structures such as star schemas or snowflake schemas for organising and querying data in a data warehouse environment. However, what sets the Kimball approach apart is its emphasis on collaboration and understanding the business needs.\nKimball emphasises that dimensional models should not be designed by data experts in isolation, but through collaborative efforts involving a deep understanding of the business and its requirements. The following is a quote from the Kimball Group which resonated with me:\n\nDimensional models should not be designed in isolation by folks who don’t fully understand the business and their needs; collaboration is critical!"

    "text": "Data modelling practitioners\nYou may be wondering whether data modelling is relevant for data or business analysts, or if it is only relevant to data engineers…\nFor data engineers, data modelling provides a structured approach to designing and organising data architectures. Well-designed data models such as star schemas facilitate efficient data management, resulting in more robust data pipelines that support the needs of the organisation.\nFor data analysts, working with well-designed data is also important because it helps ensure data accuracy and consistency, thereby enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of the subsequent data analysis.\nBusiness analysts may have a greater familiarity with data modelling compared to data analysts, given that business intelligence (BI) tools like Power BI integrate concepts and principles of data modelling. Power BI empowers users to create dimensional models using a star schema or snowflake schema, effectively organising the data into fact tables (containing numerical measures) and dimension tables (containing descriptive attributes). Data modelling contributes to faster responsiveness of data reports, making it particularly valuable for business analysts. It is worth noting though, that similar tasks of dimensional modelling can be achieved using programming languages (e.g. R, Python, Julia)."

At times, data analysts are so familiar with their data that they unintentionally overlook the importance of presenting the message in a clear and coherent manner.

Although calculating summary statistics for each variable in a dataset is a good starting point, it is often insufficient.
