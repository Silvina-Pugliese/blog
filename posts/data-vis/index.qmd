## Why data visualisation matters

Data visualisation plays a critical role for data analysis in two primary ways:

1)  It is a key aspect of understanding the data.

2)  Well-designed visualisations can be used to communicate observations and insights from data in a more impactful way.

The goal is not just to produce a visually appealing visualisation but to ensure that it conveys meaning and that it is useful to its intended audience. At times, data analysts are so familiar with their data that they unintentionally overlook the importance of presenting the message in a clear and coherent manner. This can lead to confusing or overwhelming visualisations for others who are not as familiar with the data.

## Always plot the data

Visualising data is a crucial step in exploring and analyzing it. Although calculating summary statistics for each variable in a dataset is a good starting point, it is often insufficient. This is because different datasets can produce similar or even identical summary statistics. Anscombe's quartet is a powerful demonstration of this, as shown in the screenshot below.

## Identifying observations and insights

Data visualisations are typically created for publication when there are relevant observations or insights to communicate. This is why working with domain and business experts is crucial, as they provide context that is essential for deriving insights from the analysis.

It is also beneficial to closely collaborate with domain experts when prototyping visualisations. Their feedback is invaluable in refining the message when we are mapping it into visual form.

Something to also consider is that annotations have become a commonplace addition to data visualisations as they provide readers with the contextual information they require to accurately interpret the message.

## Selecting the chart type

When considering the visual form, it is crucial to select a chart type that suits the data and the intended message. There are numerous resources available to assist with this step, and some of the ones I use are included in the reference section below.

The visualisation should emphasise what is important and enable the observer to understand the point with minimal mental effort. As mentioned earlier, annotations can be included to highlight critical information.

## About the tools

In terms of tools, I advocate for using the R programming language due to its exceptional visualisation packages, which enable us to create high-quality static and interactive visualisations that are reproducible. However, I would not discourage the use of other preferred tools, as exceptional visualisations have also been created using Power BI, Tableau, and Excel.

It is crucial to remember that the message conveyed by the visualisation is what really matters, rather than the tools used to generate it.

## In summary

In conclusion, as a data analyst you are the best person to create visualisations to communicate insights from data, keeping in mind that what may seem obvious to you may not be so for others.

Collaborate closely with domain experts to craft a message to convey visually. This is the most critical step, in my opinion.

Select a chart type that is appropriate for your data and emphasises the intended message. Utilise annotations to provide additional context that readers may need to understand the message.

Develop a deep understanding of a visualisation tool and practice using it extensively. For example, you could try to replicate well-designed visualisations to refine your skills.
